Why:
    Typst compilation is expensive; identical (cv, design, locale, settings)
    documents should not be recompiled on every request. Guardrails pattern:
    "cache renders by (yaml-hash, theme)". A small in-memory dict is enough
    for the Phase 0 scaffold (docs/plans/active/cv-editor-web-app.md);
    persistence-backed caching can replace this in a later phase.
