"""Google sign-in: the OAuth 2.0 authorization-code flow and its endpoints.

Why:
    Phase 6 of the web editor plan. Signing in must not introduce a second
    identity mechanism: the session cookie set here is the *same* signed
    `session_token` cookie the anonymous flow already uses (`auth.py`), it
    simply points at a row that now carries an account identity. That is
    what lets `get_current_user` stay untouched, and what lets an anonymous
    session be claimed without moving anything (see
    `repository.claim_anonymous_user`).

Why the whole feature is optional:
    A deployment with no Google credentials configured is a supported,
    fully working deployment -- the editor is usable anonymously. The
    endpoints here report that state rather than failing obscurely, and
    the client hides the sign-in UI when `GET /api/auth/me` says the
    provider is unavailable.

Why `id_token` is never parsed:
    The access token is exchanged server-to-server over TLS and then spent
    on Google's own userinfo endpoint, also over TLS. That avoids shipping
    a JWT verification path, and its key rotation, for information Google
    will hand over directly.
