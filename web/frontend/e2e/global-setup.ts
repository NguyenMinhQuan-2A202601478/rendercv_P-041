 *    an account from it, and the rows must exist before the first test
 *    puts one of their cookies on a browser context.
 *
 * 2. Warming the backend's first Typst render -- a freshly-started
 *    `uvicorn` pays a one-time cost there (font loading, Python import
 *    warm-up, first-call overhead in the `typst` bindings) on top of
 *    whatever a test asks for. Without this, whichever test ran first
 *    absorbed it and could push its own generous wait past its timeout;
 *    observed directly as an otherwise-stable suite failing only its first
 *    test immediately after a backend restart.
 *
 * The warm-up polls for reachability first rather than assuming the
 * `webServer` entries are already up: Playwright's `globalSetup` vs
 * `webServer` start order is not a contract this file should depend on.
