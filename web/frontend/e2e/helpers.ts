 * the backend renders through a bounded thread pool (4 workers --
 * `rendercv_web/app.py`) shared by every parallel Playwright worker's
 * browser context; under a cold backend start plus several e2e workers
 * each issuing a handful of renders in quick succession (bootstrap's own
 * first render, then each test's edits), a render can legitimately queue
 * for several seconds without anything being wrong -- the server itself
 * only gives up after 30s (`RENDER_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`). 25s leaves headroom
 * under that without masking a genuine hang.

 *
 * Why not just wait for the preview iframe's `src` to look like a blob URL
 * (the old, pre-persistence readiness check): the render/validate
 * controllers only start reacting to `documents` once bootstrap seeds it
 * (see `+page.svelte`), so nothing renders at all until bootstrap is done --
 * but relying on that as an implicit readiness signal is exactly the kind
 * of coupling that caused cross-test e2e flakiness once bootstrap became
 * async (docs/plans/active/cv-editor-web-app.md, Phase 4c follow-up): it's
 * indirect, and a future change to the render pipeline could silently
 * reintroduce a race. `+page.svelte` sets `data-app-ready="true"` on its
 * root element as an explicit, single-purpose signal for exactly this --
 * every spec should wait on it before interacting with the page.
