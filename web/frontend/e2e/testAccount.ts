 * The accounts the e2e suite runs as, and the wiring that makes them exist.
 *
 * Why the suite needs accounts at all: `/api/cvs` and `/api/preferences`
 * refuse callers without one, so a browser context with no session cookie
 * gets the sign-in gate instead of the editor.
 *
 * Why one account per test rather than one for the suite: every spec is
 * written as if it were a new visitor -- an empty CV list that bootstrap
 * fills with a fresh default CV. That used to come for free, because a new
 * browser context meant a new anonymous session. A single shared account
 * would carry one test's edits into the next.
 *
 * Why the sessions are minted here rather than by signing in for real: the
 * real flow ends at Google's consent screen, which a test cannot drive.
 * The alternative -- a test-only login endpoint on the server -- would be
 * an authentication bypass living in production code, one deployment
 * misconfiguration away from being reachable by anyone. Nothing on the
 * server knows this file exists; it builds the same signed cookie the
 * server would have issued, against a database only this suite uses.
